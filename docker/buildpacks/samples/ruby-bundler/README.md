# Sample Ruby app using Bundler

### Extended Functionality

These are optional files that provide additional functionality.

- `.profile` - A bash script that is sourced at launch time by the [launcher](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle#run).
- `.ruby-version` - Used by the [sample buildpack](../../buildpacks/ruby-bundler/) to configure what version of Ruby should be installed.
